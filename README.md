This project introduces the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. There are multiple smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features and out of all I am creating a solidity contract hosting joint savings accounts.


To automate the creation of joint savings accounts,I have created Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
